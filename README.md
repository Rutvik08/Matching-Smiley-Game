# Matching-Smiley-Game

A simple game where your screen is divided into two halves which contains smiley faces randomly placed on both the halves. 
The left side of the screen contains one extra smiley which you need to find and click on. 

The game starts with very few smileys on the screen and gets interesting and tougher as you start finding the correct smiley and the level
increases.

If you click on wrong smiley the game is over.
